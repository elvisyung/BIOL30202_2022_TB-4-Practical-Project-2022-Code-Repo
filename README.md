## Title: Investigating the Distribution of Genes of Eubacterial Origin in Proteobacteria to Pinpoint a Single Endosymbiotic Event

Abstract: The origin of eukaryotic cells is closely linked to the endosymbiotic event that led to the 3 formation of the mitochondria. The endosymbiosis theory, proposed by Lynn Margulis, is the 4 most widely accepted explanation for the origin of the eukaryotes and the mitochondria. 5 However, the question of how its complexity originated and evolved remains unresolved. 6 This study aims to investigate the distribution of genes of eubacterial origin in Proteobacteria 7 in order to pinpoint a single endosymbiotic event responsible for eukaryogenesis. Species of 8 Proteobacteria origin were compared to Pisani et al. (2007) 126 species dataset and against 9 each other. The Fluid Chromosome hypothesis was used as a framework to evaluate the 10 Syntrophy, one Endosymbiosis and Serial Endosymbiosis hypothesis. The results 11 demonstrate that all Proteobacteria are mosaic and species of alpha- and 12 deltaproteobacteria origin have similar genetic composition, implying both Syntrophy and 13 one Endosymbiosis hypothesis are acceptable explanations for eukaryogenesis.
